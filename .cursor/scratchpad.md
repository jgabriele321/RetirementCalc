# Retirement Calculator Project - Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

Building a mobile-first retirement calculator that compares cost-of-living across different U.S. ZIP codes. The application will help users understand how much they need to save for retirement by adjusting spending for regional price differences.

**Key Requirements:**
- Beautiful, mobile-first design
- Real-time calculations with smooth UX
- ZIP code autocomplete with fuzzy search
- Cost-of-living data from BEA Regional Price Parities
- Client-side calculations (no backend needed)
- Simple deployment to home server
- Static site generation for optimal performance

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. **Data Pipeline**: Need to fetch and process BEA API data into a lightweight JSON format
2. **ZIP Code Handling**: ~42k ZIP codes with fuzzy search and missing data fallback
3. **Mobile-First Design**: Responsive layout that works beautifully on all devices
4. **Real-time Calculations**: Debounced inputs with instant feedback
5. **Performance**: Keep bundle size small while maintaining rich functionality
6. **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, focus management

## Lessons

**Python Environment Management:**
- macOS with Homebrew requires virtual environments for Python packages
- Pandas 2.1.4 has compatibility issues with Python 3.13 - use pandas>=2.2.0
- Always test dependencies after installation with import statements

**Tailwind CSS v4 Configuration:**
- Uses new `@theme` directive instead of config file for custom colors
- PostCSS plugin changed to `@tailwindcss/postcss`
- Import order matters: font imports must come before `@import "tailwindcss"`

**Project Structure Lessons:**
- Hash-based routing works well for simple modal states without router dependencies
- Mobile-first responsive design requires testing at multiple breakpoints
- Component classes in CSS improve consistency and maintainability

**Data Layer Lessons:**
- React hooks provide clean abstraction for data fetching and caching
- TypeScript interfaces catch errors early and improve developer experience
- Fallback logic is essential for handling missing ZIP codes gracefully
- JSON optimization keeps bundle sizes manageable even with large datasets
- Test components are valuable for verifying data layer functionality

**Component Development Lessons:**
- Real-time updates require careful state management and debouncing
- Input validation should provide immediate visual feedback
- Accessibility features (keyboard navigation, ARIA) are essential from the start
- Mobile-first design prevents responsive issues later
- Component composition allows for flexible, maintainable architecture
- CSS-in-JS alternatives like styled-jsx have TypeScript compatibility issues

**Planner Notes**: 
- Focus on creating a beautiful, performant application with excellent UX
- Prioritize mobile-first design throughout all phases
- Keep bundle size minimal while maintaining rich functionality
- Test each component thoroughly before moving to next phase
